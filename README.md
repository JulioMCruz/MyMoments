# My Moments

Beautiful Moment for Humans. Capturing authentic human experiences on-chain, preserved as meaningful NFTs.

## User Interaction and Data Flow


1. Experience Capture: 

Users initiate the app during a significant moment (event, promise, commitment)
The AI assistant suggests ideal formats for capturing the moment based on context
Multiple verification methods are prompted at natural intervals


2. Multi-layered Verification:

Biometric verification through Self protocol confirms human presence

Location data, timestamps, and environmental factors create a "verification fingerprint"

Optional participant cross-verification strengthens authenticity


3. Memory Minting:

The AI analyzes captured media, text, and verification data to understand emotional significance

Users review an AI-generated NFT design that incorporates authentic elements from the experience

Custom metadata embeds verification proof while maintaining privacy


4. On-chain Storage:

Verified experience NFTs are stored on Opensea


5. Experience Enhancement:

The AI offers gentle reminders for commitments and suggests reunions or follow-ups

Users can connect experiences to build meaningful narratives of relationships or personal growth


## The project architecture and development process


Our solution consists of three keys components


-Verification Layer:
Integration with Self protocol for biometric verification

-NFT Generation System:
NFTs to proof the event happened

-On-chain Integration:
Base wallet integration and NFT ownership


## Product Integrations


Self Protocol: Provides the core biometric verification to confirm human presence and identity without storing sensitive biometric data

Base: Offers the wallet infrastructure and blockchain for storing NFTs, executing smart contracts, and managing digital assets

OpenAI API: Powers natural language understanding and generative components of the AI assistant


## Key differentiators and uniqueness of the project


Moments stands apart from similar attestation or NFT platforms through:


Authentic Verification: Unlike simple POAPs or attendance NFTs, our platform verifies the authenticity of human experiences using multiple data points

Meaningful NFTs: Instead of generic tokens, our NFTs incorporate elements that truly represent the experience's emotional and personal significance

Commitment Tracking: Beyond simple attestation, we enable promise verification and fulfillment tracking with accountability

Relationship Narratives: Users can build connected stories of relationships and experiences over time, creating a meaningful on-chain life narrative


## Trade-offs and shortcuts while building


Some compromises we made during developemnt is the lack of additon of an ai agent. We decided that integrating a strong layer of verification was more essential to our project.
